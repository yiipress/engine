# Plugins

Plugins are stored in the `plugins` directory.

## Custom parsers

Custom parsers are used to parse content from source files and are executed before primary markdown parsing.

For example, you can create a custom parser for shortcode such as `[youtube id="..."/]`
that will produce an HTML snippet embedding a YouTube video.
