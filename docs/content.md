# Content files

Content that YiiPress is generating from is stored in the `content` directory.

## Collections

First level directories are "collections".

## Entries

In each collection directory there are entries.

Each entry file is a markdown file with a yaml frontmatter defining entry metadata.

## Assets

There could be `assets` directory in the collection directory. Within this directory there could be assets such as images
that are used in entry markdown.
